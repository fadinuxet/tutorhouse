# Tutorhouse - Project Brief

## ðŸŽ¯ One-Liner
Tutorhouse is the "TikTok for Tutor Discovery," transforming how students find the perfect tutor through engaging vertical video demos and live sessions.

## ðŸ§  The Problem
Finding a great tutor online is broken. Static text profiles and reviews fail to answer the most critical question: *"Is this tutor's teaching style right for me?"* The process is slow, impersonal, and lacks the trust needed to book a costly session.

## ðŸ’¡ Our Solution
A shoppertainment-powered mobile app where tutors showcase their skills through **short intro videos** and **interactive live demo sessions**. Students discover tutors by swiping through a engaging, full-screen feed, building trust *before* they book.

## ðŸŽª The "Shoppertainment" Magic
- **For Students:** A addictive, TikTok-style feed to discover tutors. Watch a 60-second video or drop into a live demo, then book instantly.
- **For Tutors:** A content platform to build their personal brand. Go live to attract new students, build a video portfolio, and stop competing on price alone.

## ðŸš€ Our Advantage
We are not a startup from zero. We have an existing tutoring service with **58+ pre-vetted tutors** and a proven booking operation. We are productizing our acquisition funnel.
