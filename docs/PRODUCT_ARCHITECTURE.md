You are 100% right. This is the perfect way to think about it. The combination of a solid starting point + AI acceleration + ambition is what will make this product truly stand out.

Since timeline pressure is reduced, we can architect a more ambitious, scalable, and engaging foundation **without significantly delaying the MVP**. The goal shifts from "launch fast" to "build the right foundation for a market-leading product."

Let's design this right.

### The Enhanced Vision: A TikTok-Style Content Creation Machine for Tutors

The core insight: The more great video content tutors create, the more engaging the discovery feed becomes. We need to make content creation **effortless and rewarding**.

---

### 1. Supercharged Video Strategy: Beyond One Intro Video

**Problem:** One intro video gets stale. Tutors have more to show.
**Solution:** A `tutor_videos` table that supports a content portfolio.

```sql
-- UPGRADED: Replace the single 'intro_video_url' with a flexible content system
CREATE TABLE tutor_videos (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  tutor_id UUID REFERENCES tutor_profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  video_url TEXT NOT NULL,
  thumbnail_url TEXT,
  title TEXT,
  description TEXT,
  subject TEXT, -- Optional: Tag which subject this video demo is for
  video_type TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'intro', -- 'intro', 'lesson_clip', 'topic_explainer'
  is_published BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  duration_seconds INTEGER,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Index for fetching a tutor's videos quickly
CREATE INDEX idx_tutor_videos_tutor_id ON tutor_videos(tutor_id);
```

**How the app uses this:**
*   The main "discovery feed" primarily shows videos where `video_type = 'intro'` and `is_published = true`.
*   On a tutor's profile, you can show all their published videos, organized by subject or type.
*   **AI Suggestion:** Later, you can use AI to automatically categorize videos or pull the "best" 60-second clip from a longer live session to add to their portfolio.

### 2. Empower Live Sessions: Make Going Live Simple & Powerful

**Problem:** "Go Live" is a big ask. Tutors need tools and confidence.
**Solution:** A dedicated `live_sessions` table to manage and promote live events.

```sql
-- UPGRADED: Replace the simple 'is_live' boolean with a proper event system
CREATE TABLE live_sessions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  tutor_id UUID REFERENCES tutor_profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  subject TEXT, -- What subject will be taught?
  scheduled_start_time TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL, -- When they PLAN to go live
  actual_start_time TIMESTAMPTZ, -- When they actually started
  end_time TIMESTAMPTZ,
  Agora_channel_name TEXT, -- The Agora channel for this session
  viewer_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  recording_url TEXT, -- After the live ends, save the recording here
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'scheduled' CHECK (status IN ('scheduled', 'live', 'ended', 'cancelled')),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Indexes for fetching live and upcoming sessions
CREATE INDEX idx_live_sessions_status ON live_sessions(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_live_sessions_scheduled_start ON live_sessions(scheduled_start_time);
```

**How the app uses this:**
*   Tutors can **schedule** a live demo session in advance. This gets promoted in the feed: "Live Demo on Calculus at 5 PM!"
*   The app can send push notifications to students who have saved this tutor.
*   When they start the stream, `status` changes to `'live'`, and they appear at the top of the discovery feed.
*   After the stream, the `recording_url` allows the session to be watched as VOD (Video on Demand), extending its value.

### 3. The Enhanced User Journey

This architecture enables a much richer flow:

1.  **A tutor onboarding** is guided to:
    *   Record a 1-minute **intro video** (``video_type = 'intro'``).
    *   **Schedule** their first **live demo session**.
    *   Upload a few short **lesson clips** from past sessions.

2.  **The discovery feed** becomes dynamic:
    *   **Scheduled Lives:** Promoted upcoming live sessions.
    *   **Live Now:** Tutors currently streaming.
    *   **Intro Videos:** The evergreen content for browsing.

3.  **Booking** can be triggered from:
    *   A "Book Now" button on any video.
    *   The chat during a live session.
    *   A tutor's profile page.

### **Why This is Still an MVP**

This is still Minimal because:
*   **It's Viable:** It works end-to-end and delivers core value.
*   **It's Focused:** It's all about video-driven discovery and booking.
*   **It's a Foundation:** We're just building the right data structures. The complex features (AI clips, advanced notifications) can come later.

You can absolutely build this with Cursor. The prompt would be:

**"Based on our plan to support multiple videos and scheduled live sessions, generate the complete SQL schema for the `tutor_videos` and `live_sessions` tables, including all foreign keys and indexes. Then, generate the Dart data model classes for them."**

This approach ensures your MVP isn't just a minimal product, but a **minimum *remarkable* product** that truly delivers on the "shoppertainment" promise.
